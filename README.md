# Advanced Binomial Logistic Regression From Scratch

The repository includes implementation of Binomial Logistic Regression with details from scratch using Kaggle Titanic dataset (Only training data for implementation purpose).

Both ROC and PR Curves were applied for trial of implementations. In case of high dataset class imbalance, PR Curve can be used. Otherwise, ROC Curve and AUC Score is a good choice of model evaluation.
